Everything has become a cloud - even the formerly-rigid wireless proprietary nodes, known as base stations, are broken up to independently developed network micro-services running on cloud-native runtimes supported by commodity compute and storage. Networking has become a software business and complete network disaggregation is the end game. In this new world, network operators are increasingly becoming content providers and they abandon R&D-heavy network disaggregation initiatives run by the Linux Foundation and increasingly trust public cloud providers to run their networks and take full advantage of the public cloud completely abstracted set of APIs to build applications faster than they could ever do before.\nDrawing from these trends, the course aims on one hand to provide a foundation of the so called multi-cloud network environment and on the other, to provide the student with the tools and knowledge required to understand how these multi-cloud networks are operated / managed via a set of data-driven distributed applications, the Cognitive Network Apps, that bring Machine Learning / AI and big network data analytics together.
