The seminar in Digital Modeling and Fabrication is a 3-credit course for upper level students exploring advanced 3-dimensional computer modeling techniques and data export for assembly and fabrication to various computer numerically controlled (CNC) hardware available at the School of Architecture. Specifically, students engage in NURBS and solid modeling using Rhinoceros 3D and export data through various Rhino plug-ins including RhinoCAM, which writes G- and M- Codes for 2 and 3D milling operations. CNC hardware available as of Spring 2010 includes two (2) Universal Laser Cutters, each with 18\" x 32\" beds; two (2) Z-Corporation Z-310 3 dimensional printers; and a Precix 9100 Industrial CNC Router with a 48\" x 96\" bed. Students model and fabricate full scale assemblies individually and in teams and contribute to a final exhibition of student work. Familiarity with various software tools available at the College of Architecture and Design is encouraged but not required.

How can we plan more effectively for an uncertain future? Students will leave the course with a better understanding of how variability affects both themselves as individuals, and society at large. They will also be exposed to a broad sampling of different disciplines within the natural sciences, including physics, statistics, neuroscience, psychology, ecology, and geography.",

The objective of this course is to expose students to the broad field of animal behavior.  The course will include the historical underpinnings of the field as well as the contemporary theories for a wide variety of behaviors.  Behavioral ecology and the evolution of animal behaviors as adaptations will be intertwined throughout the course, as well potential applications of knowledge about animal behavior. Students will be able to analyze existing evidence and investigate modern practices in order to evaluate existing theories and consider potential future directions of animal behavior.  Using current scientific literature, as well as case-studies, students will be able to come up with their own hypotheses and determine how different hypotheses related to animal behavior can be tested experimentally.  Students will also gain hands-on experience in trying out some of the fundamental techniques."

Additional topics include: hierarchical structure, sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, negative feedback control, and characteristic traits of models.  Students will use models to gain insight into how a physiological system functions and to design a biomedical engineering device or procedure that interacts with the physiological system.  Systems studied include the cardiovascular system,  gas exchange in the lungs, nerve and muscle action potentials, and musculo-skeletal spinal reflex.",

The course will cover the structure and properties of materials used as biomaterials including metals, ceramics, synthetic polymers, and biopolymers. The structure of these materials will be explored to understand how it defines the behavior of a material. The bulk behavior of materials will be reviewed, including the generalized Hooke's Law, and new concepts will be introduced (including thermal strain, surface properties, and viscoelasticity). Students will be presented with problems of property characterization, failure analysis and performance testing. Students will work in teams to analyze a marketed implant or device using biomaterial(s) using the tool and concepts learned in the course.",

Historically, the chemistry curriculum has focused on understanding the nature of matter and the use of that understanding to build exciting products to make life more comfortable, safe, and secure. However, sustainable chemistry is rarely taught to chemists in any depth, if at all. Education in chemical science and engineering must change rapidly to deal with unsustainability. This course emphasizes the concept of sustainable risks, i.e., that each chemical reaction and conversion process has risks associated with the production, and the role of chemists and engineers is to minimize this risk and reduce the impact on human health and the environment.",

Optimization techniques provide the core foundation for the processing of the data and learning from it. This course covers the basic analytical and algorithmic optimization tools that lay the foundation for the data analytics and deep learning systems. Specific topics include single-objective convex optimization (duality, optimality conditions, algorithms), gradients-based methods, and the fundamentals of multi-objective optimization and game theory. The theoretical foundation and the fundamental algorithms are applied to real-world scenarios that utilize supervised learning models, including nonlinear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, and deep neural networks.",

With the explosion of \u201cBig Data\u201d problems, statistical learning has become a very hot field in many scientific areas as well as in marketing, finance, and business. Statistical learning refers to a vast set of tools for understanding data. Specifically, supervised statistical learning involves building a statistical model to predict or estimate an output or pattern based on one or more inputs. For unsupervised learning there are inputs, but no supervising output, and here the goal is to learn relationships and structure from the data. This course provides a systematic introduction to statistical machine learning and pattern recognition using fundamental performance criteria as guiding principles and studies how these principles affect real-world performance. Topics covered include practical techniques as linear and kernel models for classification and regression, unsupervised probabilistic modeling, probabilistic graphical models, and approximate inference, but also theoretical underpinnings as VC dimension and sample complexity.",

Restriction: This course is intended for engineering majors. This is a course for junior level undergraduates in any engineering discipline focusing on the use of data science techniques to solve problems in engineering. We will first discuss the Python programming language and how it can be used to access, manipulate, explore, and visualize scientific datasets. We will discuss statistics and probability as it applies to engineering problems such as safety factors and probability of part failure; this includes conditional probability, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and Bayesian inference. We will then discuss more advanced statistical models (\u201cmachine learning\u201d), including linear and logistic regression, decision trees, and clustering. Possible applications of these methods will be demonstrated in such disciplines and topics as (but not limited to): chemical, mechanical and electrical engineering (optimization and controls), materials engineering (structure and property databases), biomedical engineering (medical diagnosis and medical imaging) and electrical and computer engineering (signal processing, target tracking, robotic navigation). Students will gain hands-on experience in implementing and utilizing these various methods through computational laboratory assignments and reports and a semester-long engineering design project.",

Design includes learning to develop \"mockups\" of how the site will look and how people will use it. The major tools for building websites will be industry standard HTML and XHTML to describe webpage content, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for flexibly formatting the content. Using XHTML and CSS makes it relatively simple to change formats across the entire site, as well as \"future-proofs\" a website, allowing it to be viewed on every major web browser (such as Firefox or Chrome) and easily adapt to changes in future browser technology.

This includes designing and dynamically changing tabs and menus, as well as expanding and contracting sections of pages. Students will develop a thorough understanding of website usability (designing effective sites that people like, security and user privacy, browser capability (ensuring websites work on every major web browser), and the tools and skills that web developers use to add interactive features to websites. These skills include Javascript (for programming interactive features), the Document Object Model or DOM (specifying the internal structure of web pages), JQuery (to access information utilizing this internal structure, create animations and generally streamline Javascript), browser variables (providing information about the browser characteristics), HTML input forms, form validation (ensuring correctness of user input), securing user input (to ensure user privacy), cookies (tracking user information), basic communication with the web server (which processes the information users input into forms), and AJAX ( which integrates many of these technologies).

Businesses use databases extensively for analysis and decision-making because they provide efficient, large-scale information storage and rapid retrieval. Databases support the \"back end functionality\" of most large web systems. This course gives students extensive, pragmatic experience in designing, building, querying, updating, maintaining and managing relational databases, using the Structured Query Language (SQL). Proper database design principles are emphasized throughout the course, beginning with high level descriptions of relational databases using data modeling tools (such as entity-relationship or ER diagrams)and progressing to relational database design principles based on higher order normalizations. We will examine some poorly designed databases and show how these can be transformed into well designed databases. SQL will be extensively covered, and students will design and implement sophisticated SQL queries invoking self-joins, outer joins, correlated subqueries and related concepts. Students will explore and utilize design methodologies for input data validation and maintaining database integrity, and study issues of database privacy and security. Advanced topics to be discussed include the role of the Database Administrator (DBA), database life cycle activities, database denormalization, read-only databases and data warehouses. Hands-on experience will be gained by working with actual databases using industry-standard database management systems such as Oracle.

This course introduces students to the world of business analytics from an information systems perspective, focusing on the application of various data analysis techniques in business practices. We cover a wide spectrum of topics ranging from fundamental statistics to database, data warehouse, data visualization, and data mining, with a special focus on predictive analysis. Being an introductory course, our approach is \u201cshallow and wide\u201d, emphasizing on giving students a complete view of the data analytics profession, covering as many different sub-areas as time allows while not diving too deep into any one specific domain. The goal is to serve as a \u201cguided tour\u201d for students to gain knowledge about the different sub-areas of data analytics and understanding of which area is a best fit for their personal developments. More in-depth materials and discussion for each sub-area will be provided upon students\u2019 requests. Course topics include the rudiments of probability and random variables, and visualization, data warehousing and OLAP analysis, dashboard, scorecard, data mining algorithms, optimization techniques, DSS and knowledge systems.",

Requirements engineering is one of the all-important beginning stages of the systems development life cycle. Revealing and understanding the system's requirements is a crucial component of success for developing new computing systems or adjusting existing applications. This course covers the theory, principles, and practical application of the methodologies and tools for requirements engineering. The focus is development of large software systems and the integration of multiple systems into a comprehensive, domain dependent solution. All aspects of requirements engineering including the knowledge and skills needed to elicit and analyze requirements, translate these requirements into technical specifications, verify that the requirements accurately capture the system requirements, and manage software requirements through the system development cycle will be covered. Students will actively participate in discussions, labs and exercises, and prepare operational requirements and technical specifications for real-world problems. We will spend a considerable amount of time interacting and learning through discussion of assigned readings and other material.",

These are not the only elements of theatre that do this, but this course is an opportunity to focus on these specialties often overlooked and uses the foundation and making of PPP to learn digital, physical, interpersonal, and playful skills needed to tell stories in unexpected ways. The history, craft, and techniques of PPP are vast, and students will gain an exposure to this knowledge while engaging in class workshops, research, and continuous prototyping. Along with their skills in text analysis and collaboration, students will be challenged to use just these three elements to enhance a story and create cohesive, transformative, theatrical moments.",

This course is for students in computing majors. Students will gain a comprehensive overview of the evolution of computing from the start of recorded history through modern times. By studying history, you will understand the context of modern developments in CS/IT, including cyclical trends and why various approaches did or did not work. Learning where it all came from will also help young computer scientists to speak intelligently with older colleagues and managers in the workforce. Topics include mechanical calculating, analog computing, relay/tube computers, transistors, integrated circuits, I/O such as punch cards/paper tape/floppy disks, the minicomputer generation, the microcomputer revolution, development of graphical and network systems, early mobile computer, and modern history. A special focus on historic developments in New Jersey will be part of all lectures."

They explore an overarching programming paradigm that integrates two distinct architectural models to tackle complex challenges, such as training generative or agentic AI models using convolution neural networks and performing inference with latent search. Through the Message Passing Interface (MPI), students learn to program clusters of Linux computers, embodying the Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD) architectural model. Simultaneously, they delve into Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) to program thousands of GPU cores, following the Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) architectural model. By employing the Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) programming paradigm, students combine MPI and CUDA to address large-scale problems on CUDA-capable Linux clusters effectively.\nThe topics on MPI entail mainly communication mechanisms between many computers, which are point to point, collective, and one-sided. The topics on CUDA entail primarily methodologies to solve essential computing problems, including convolution, histogram, reduction, prefix sum (scan), merge, radix sorting, graph traversal, and convolution neural networks. The course is project-oriented and as such at the end of semester, students will be able to solve a difficult problem using a cluster of CUDA-capable computers."

Unlike traditional pipelines that use centralized datasets collected from the web to train ML models, these new data modes result in heterogeneous siloed data residing in the devices or organizations that generated it. To make use of this decentralized data, we focus on collaborative and federated ML, which enables secure and trustworthy learning across multiple parties and diverse data sources."

In this intensive hands-on course, students will learn how to design computer programs to \u201cgrab\u201d information from social networking systems such as Facebook, and analyze this to reveal useful but  hidden information about the users and their interconnections.  Since math is the only language that computers understand, the goal of this class is to build connections between the human language one finds in social network postings and profiles, and mathematical formulas.   The skills and techniques utilized in the course will prepare students for advanced courses in data mining and business analytics.

In this course, we will study how security and privacy decisions are made in the real world, how incomplete or faulty assumptions may cause mistakes to be made, and what it takes to design and develop systems that overcome these issues. The course will synthesize and present important research in security, privacy, and human-computer interaction. In addition, students will learn and practice techniques, which are commonly used by user experience researchers, that will help them independently evaluate the usability of systems."

This course will use the examination of an on-campus ecosystem, the dining hall, as a framework for learning about a number of applied ecological concepts. We will investigate topics such as food webs, nutrient cycling, microbial ecology, and agroecology as they apply to the organisms and biological processes, present in our dining hall. Course work will involve extensive reading and discussion of scientific and popular literature, supplemented by regular class trips to the dining hall and related on-campus facilities."

This lecture course explores the neural mechanisms underlying animal behavior. This course is intended for upper-level undergraduate students who have some background in biology, hence the prerequisite for Foundation of Biology. This courses would also be of interest to graduate students interested in neuroscience, such as, students in the Quantitative Neuroscience (QNS) program, students in the Integrative Neuroscience (INS) program, and students at the Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience (CMB). It is unnecessary for the students to have taken animal behavior or neurobiology; however, these courses would be helpful."

This course builds upon foundational knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and evolution to explore the morphological evolution of vertebrates within the context of the functional interrelationships of organs and the changing environments to which vertebrates have adapted. Through an advanced investigation into the mechanics of how living creatures interact with their immediate physical world, we examine how the forms and activities of animals reflect the materials available to evolution and consider rules for structural design under environmental forces. In addition to the prerequisites, it is recommended that a student have at least two of the following courses: Evolution (BIOL\u00a0222); Mammalian Physiology (BIOL\u00a0340); Developmental Biology (BIOL\u00a0342); Genetics (BIOL\u00a0352)."

We will examine how the forms and activities of animals and plants reflect the materials available to nature, consider rules for fluid flow and structural design, and explore how organisms contend with environmental forces. Drawing on physics, we look at how animals swim and fly, modes of terrestrial locomotion, organism responses to winds and water currents, circulatory and suspension-feeding systems, the relationship between size and mechanical design, and the links between the properties of biological materials (eg spider silk, jellyfish jelly, and muscle) and their structural and functional roles."

To demonstrate their learning, students will develop compositions in graphic and written mediums and analyze how graphic narratives serve as powerful tools for both aesthetic based and analytical arguments. In addition, students will reflect on how their compositions reshape their ideas about authorship, digital communications, narrative, and consider the ways in which visual composition transfers to other disciplines and professions. The course is built on the idea that composing graphic narratives improves rhetorical awareness, media fluency, and likewise provides opportunities to reevaluate the writing process."

We will learn the basic therapeutic and destructive aspects of radiation from electrical fields at frequencies from below 60 cps to x-rays and beyond. We will also use active learning and prepare reports on research projects in class. In a general sense, the biophysical properties of radiation are important in the human nervous systems, in cancer treatment and in carcinogenesis. During this course, we will explore how nuclear radiation is unnecessarily feared in some cases and appropriately feared in others. The course is designed for Biophysics and Biology majors, but is also geared to Biomedical Engineers and Chemists."

Social psychology is the recognition that human responses are influenced by social situations, in addition to, the products of our individual personalities. Social psychologists study interpersonal and group dynamics and social challenges, such as prejudice, implicit bias, bullying, criminal activity and substance abuse. They research social interactions and the factors that influence them, such as group behavior, attitudes, public perceptions and leadership.

Instead of covering different types of materials separately, this course will use the principles common to engineering of all important materials as an underlying theme. These are atomic/molecular structure, nanoscale, morphology, principles of phase transformation, structure development during processing, and property dependence on structure. All these topics will be introduced through the paradigm of comparing metals, ceramics and polymers. Besides single component systems, advanced materials such as multiphase and/or multicomponent systems (e.g. composites and gels) and nanomaterials will be discussed based on these principles. An integral part of this course will be the criteria for selection of materials for specific end-use conditions and customer specifications, which can incorporate various engineering standards and multiple constraints such as public health, safety, and welfare, as well as global, cultural, social, environmental, and economic factors."

Methods focus on approaches that minimized the contribution for operator and instrument errors on the observations. In part 2, emphasis is on data preparation, reductions, and processing for coordinate computations. Part 3 focuses on CAD methods for preparing as-built site plans, plat or survey diagram, survey work plan, CAD modeling capabilities to construct a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) or a Digital Surface Model (DSM), topographic mapping outputs, and construct GIS layers from survey data. The emphasis of this course is on hands-on exercises in the practice of geospatial data collection, handling instrumentation, data processing and data representation."

Everything has become a cloud - even the formerly-rigid wireless proprietary nodes, known as base stations, are broken up to independently developed network micro-services running on cloud-native runtimes supported by commodity compute and storage. Networking has become a software business and complete network disaggregation is the end game. In this new world, network operators are increasingly becoming content providers and they abandon R&D-heavy network disaggregation initiatives run by the Linux Foundation and increasingly trust public cloud providers to run their networks and take full advantage of the public cloud completely abstracted set of APIs to build applications faster than they could ever do before.\nDrawing from these trends, the course aims on one hand to provide a foundation of the so called multi-cloud network environment and on the other, to provide the student with the tools and knowledge required to understand how these multi-cloud networks are operated / managed via a set of data-driven distributed applications, the Cognitive Network Apps, that bring Machine Learning / AI and big network data analytics together. We treat the most important networking architectures and technologies that empower today\u2019s cloud provider networks at the core / edge such as CDN and 5G and learn how self-healing, self-optimization and self-configuration applications provide the reliability, resiliency and performance metrics needed by cloud applications such as Netflix, Zoom and many others."

Simultaneously, they delve into CUDA programming to exploit thousands of GPU cores under the SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) model. By adopting the SPMD (Single Program Multiple Data) paradigm, students learn to synergize MPI and CUDA to tackle large-scale challenges such as training advanced neural networks for generative and agentic AI, as well as performing complex inference with latent search.

This course will provide students with an overview of social networks by introducing them to the unique terminology of social networks (centrality, boundary spanners, directional ties, etc.) Positive and negative characteristics of social networks will be discussed, followed by visualizations and analyses of those characteristics. Students will  read selected journal articles explaining how social networks relate to communication and the flow of information within organizations. The culmination of the course will be a project in which students will create and analyze their own social network, most likely drawing their data from the popular social media site Facebook and using ORA, a freeware social network analysis application created by Carnegie Mellon University."

Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problems, eigenfunction expansion, orthogonality of functions, and Fourier and generalized Fourier series are presented with the dual purpose of solving boundary-value problems and building the foundation needed for solving partial differential equations. Separation of variables is used to solve partial differential equations in 2D-3D steady-state and 1D-3D transient problems that arise in Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates. Laplace transform and similarity transformation are used to solve semi-infinite domain problems. Numerical methods based on finite differences, full or semi-discretization of partial differential equations, accuracy, and error estimates are covered."

In the lectures, the students will be introduced to environmental regulations, the theoretical concepts for environmental sampling design, the procedures for analytical techniques, and traditional and cutting-edge remediation approaches. These lectures will be supplemented with peer-reviewed articles, technical reports, and operational methods. The field studies will consist in sampling collection methods, where the students will participate in a one-day sampling trip to a contaminated site to collect water, sediments, and plants samples. The students will then process the samples in the laboratory for further analysis for the contaminants of interest. Using this information, the students will prepare a Feasibility Study/Remedial Investigation (FS/RI) for their targeted site where they will evaluate three to five remediation strategies and will propose one final remediation design. The final RI/RD will be presented to the whole class in a mock Community Advisory Group (CAG) session."

Unfortunately, traditional water and wastewater treatment processes do not effectively remove them, and thus advanced and novel technologies have been developed over recent decades to address these contaminants. This course will introduce students to the theoretical concepts and design of such novel systems for treating ECs.

This is a course for graduate level students in chemical engineering, materials engineering, pharmaceutical engineering, or a related discipline. The focus is on the use of data science techniques to solve problems in chemical engineering. We will first discuss the Python programming language and how it can be used to manipulate, clean, explore, and visualize scientific datasets using the pandas package. We will the cover statistics and probability as it applies to engineering problems; this includes conditional probability, probability distributions, hypothesis testing, and Bayesian inference. Basic supervised machine learning models will be introduced, including linear and logistic regression, decision trees and random forest, and support vector machines. Students will then learn different analytical techniques and how to combine all of these skills to solve engineering problems involving large amounts of data and make predictions. Finally, we will cover how to access data and create your own datasets; topics include databases (including relational databases such as SQL) and basic data mining and web scraping. Applications of these methods will be demonstrated in chemical engineering (e.g., optimization and controls, sensor analysis), materials engineering (e.g., structural databases and property selection), and pharmaceutical engineering (e.g., drug selection). Students will gain hands-on experience in implementing and utilizing these various methods through computational laboratory assignments and reports and a semester-long engineering design project."
