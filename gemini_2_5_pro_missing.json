This course is for students in computing majors. Students will gain a comprehensive overview of the evolution of computing from the start of recorded history through modern times. By studying history, you will understand the context of modern developments in CS/IT, including cyclical trends and why various approaches did or did not work. Learning where it all came from will also help young computer scientists to speak intelligently with older colleagues and managers in the workforce. Topics include mechanical calculating, analog computing, relay/tube computers, transistors, integrated circuits, I/O such as punch cards/paper tape/floppy disks, the minicomputer generation, the microcomputer revolution, development of graphical and network systems, early mobile computer, and modern history. A special focus on historic developments in New Jersey will be part of all lectures."

They explore an overarching programming paradigm that integrates two distinct architectural models to tackle complex challenges, such as training generative or agentic AI models using convolution neural networks and performing inference with latent search. Through the Message Passing Interface (MPI), students learn to program clusters of Linux computers, embodying the Multiple Instruction Multiple Data (MIMD) architectural model. Simultaneously, they delve into Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) to program thousands of GPU cores, following the Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) architectural model. By employing the Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) programming paradigm, students combine MPI and CUDA to address large-scale problems on CUDA-capable Linux clusters effectively.\nThe topics on MPI entail mainly communication mechanisms between many computers, which are point to point, collective, and one-sided. The topics on CUDA entail primarily methodologies to solve essential computing problems, including convolution, histogram, reduction, prefix sum (scan), merge, radix sorting, graph traversal, and convolution neural networks. The course is project-oriented and as such at the end of semester, students will be able to solve a difficult problem using a cluster of CUDA-capable computers."

In this intensive hands-on course, students will learn how to design computer programs to \u201cgrab\u201d information from social networking systems such as Facebook, and analyze this to reveal useful but  hidden information about the users and their interconnections.  Since math is the only language that computers understand, the goal of this class is to build connections between the human language one finds in social network postings and profiles, and mathematical formulas.   The skills and techniques utilized in the course will prepare students for advanced courses in data mining and business analytics.  This course requires basic statistical knowledge and Java programming skills."

In this course, we will study how security and privacy decisions are made in the real world, how incomplete or faulty assumptions may cause mistakes to be made, and what it takes to design and develop systems that overcome these issues. The course will synthesize and present important research in security, privacy, and human-computer interaction. In addition, students will learn and practice techniques, which are commonly used by user experience researchers, that will help them independently evaluate the usability of systems."

This course is for students who would like to explore and produce interactive and kinetic products or building prototypes using microcontrollers (Arduino), sensors, and actuators. The course will focus on producing creative and aesthetically articulated applications of robotic technologies. Topics include applications of adaptable, responsive, and distributed systems to various fields of design. The course will take a hands-on approach to learn about sensors (such as light, sound, motion, and gesture-tracking sensors, for example, Microsoft Kinect sensor), actuators (such as servo motors), graphic/game design/simulation software (Processing, Unreal Engine, and Unity3D), and prototyping using available digital fabrication tools such as laser cutters, 3-D printers, and CNC machines at the CoAD and others. Topics from IoT (Internet of Things) will be also explored for those who are interested in creating smart products. Recommended for 5th-, 4th-, and 3rd-year students with basic knowledge on programming, 3-D modeling, and digital fabrication skills. Open to students from any college. Non-CoAD students with appropriate backgrounds are welcome to join the course."

Corequisites:BIOL\u00a0340.  This course will use simulations and practical lab experiments to demonstrate general principles of the function of the human body as a mammal, with emphasis on the function and regulation of neuromuscular, cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, digestive, and excretory systems. The goal is to provide students with the basic knowledge to understand how their own bodies operate."

This lecture course explores the neural mechanisms underlying animal behavior. This course is intended for upper-level undergraduate students who have some background in biology, hence the prerequisite for Foundation of Biology. This courses would also be of interest to graduate students interested in neuroscience, such as, students in the Quantitative Neuroscience (QNS) program, students in the Integrative Neuroscience (INS) program, and students at the Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience (CMB). It is unnecessary for the students to have taken animal behavior or neurobiology; however, these courses would be helpful."

This course builds upon foundational knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and evolution to explore the morphological evolution of vertebrates within the context of the functional interrelationships of organs and the changing environments to which vertebrates have adapted. Through an advanced investigation into the mechanics of how living creatures interact with their immediate physical world, we examine how the forms and activities of animals reflect the materials available to evolution and consider rules for structural design under environmental forces. In addition to the prerequisites, it is recommended that a student have at least two of the following courses: Evolution (BIOL\u00a0222); Mammalian Physiology (BIOL\u00a0340); Developmental Biology (BIOL\u00a0342); Genetics (BIOL\u00a0352)."

This course will explore Substance Use Disorder from a biological viewpoint. The psychological, epidemiological, social and economical aspects of addiction will be touched upon as needed. The course will consist of several Modules that would be taught in parallel. The Modules include: \u2018Psychopharmacology\u2019, \u2018The Structure and Function of the Nervous System\u2019, \u2018Neurotransmitters and Neuromodulators\u2019, \u2018Substances of Abuse\u2019, and \u2018What is Addiction?\u2019 The goal is to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of biological mechanisms, both in the body and in the brain, that lead to and underlie Substance Use Disorder."

We will examine how the forms and activities of animals and plants reflect the materials available to nature, consider rules for fluid flow and structural design, and explore how organisms contend with environmental forces. Drawing on physics, we look at how animals swim and fly, modes of terrestrial locomotion, organism responses to winds and water currents, circulatory and suspension-feeding systems, the relationship between size and mechanical design, and the links between the properties of biological materials (eg spider silk, jellyfish jelly, and muscle) and their structural and functional roles."

To demonstrate their learning, students will develop compositions in graphic and written mediums and analyze how graphic narratives serve as powerful tools for both aesthetic based and analytical arguments. In addition, students will reflect on how their compositions reshape their ideas about authorship, digital communications, narrative, and consider the ways in which visual composition transfers to other disciplines and professions. The course is built on the idea that composing graphic narratives improves rhetorical awareness, media fluency, and likewise provides opportunities to reevaluate the writing process."
